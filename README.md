# Zetamac-but-better
My own version of the popular online arithmetic website - <a href="https://arithmetic.zetamac.com">Zetamac.</a>

Inspired by the mental maths arithmetic website, I decided to build it myself, but better.

With new additional features such as:
1. No more automatic answer submission if the user types in the correct result. The user must now instead press the enter key on their keyboard to submit the answer. This will not only ensure the user isn't luckily guessing the correct answer and also prevents soft-locks when stuck on a particularly challenging calculation.

2. Detailed results window after the game ends. It will display a variety of data such as average time spent on each question, keystroke pattern on the user's keyboard, and more. All of this data will be fed into a feedback form that will show the user's weak areas and guide the user on what type of questions they should practice more to get faster.

3. Training mode. If enabled, the game will adapt after each game played the user and generate more questions targeting the user's weaknesses in the following games to help them improve.
